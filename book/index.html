<h2 id="life-a-grand-spectacle">LIFE: A GRAND SPECTACLE</h2>
<p>Sitting in my balcony, I often wonder, what is
the secret to my existence? Do I have a role
to perform in this play called Life? If so, then
where is the director of this master play?
Well, this seems to be a unique spectacle
where the director resides in the soul of
each performer. The actors, who follow the
director’s will, light up their stage of life with
happiness and peace.
But what is the director’s will? It is a simple
mantra: Spread love, have faith in self and be
grateful for all his giving. This might sound
tough to implement but it is the only way to
enhance our act.
Friends, the divine director have given each
one of us a beautiful and unique role to play.
Let us follow his directions and give our best
performance!</p>
<h3 id="living-in-gratitude">LIVING IN GRATITUDE</h3>
<p>We often curse the Almighty for all the events
that take place in our lives, on a daily basis.
Never do we pay heed to the motive behind a
specific action to take place. All our goals and
aims are transitory. We vie for things, keeping
a specific prospect or objective in mind.
However, the Creator designs our journey, our
road map, keeping diverse scenarios in mind.
His plans are eternal and definite.
He knows what is best for us and shapes our
lives accordingly.
So, instead of cribbing every day, let us thank
him for all his giving and trust his plan!</p>
<h3 id="sail-with-the-wind">SAIL WITH THE WIND</h3>
<p>Nothing on this planet is permanent, be it
people, circumstances, failure or victory. The
wheel of life spins constantly, generating new
experiences each day. But, we rarely accept
the change that life offers. We try our best to
restore the previous conditions but always fail
to do so.
Well, friends, to be successful, it is imperative
that we embrace change and reshape our lives
accordingly. The ability to happily sustain
these varying conditions decides our fate.
So, adjust your sails according to the wind and
add yet another ingredient to your recipe of
life: the acceptance to change.</p>
<h3 id="bring-the-change-today">BRING THE CHANGE TODAY</h3>
<p>Every day, we scan through the newspaper
which is a log book of various injustices and
crimes performed all across the globe. The
headlines are usually a repeat of the following
terms: Child Abuse, Drug Supply, Murder and
Rape. But how has this brutality prevailed
over the world? Who has caused it? Sadly,
we are the major culprits. Our ignorance to
misbehaviour, our tolerance to ill deeds and
our silence to injustice has fuelled immoral
motives of people and the result is right in
front of our eyes.
But, it is never too late to change. We can’t
erase the past but we can indeed write the
future by being vigilant and responsible
citizens showing marked hatred for the
offenders and awarding harshest punishment
to the miscreants. The time to act begins&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="living-together-forever">LIVING TOGETHER FOREVER</h3>
<p>We are a part of the majestic creation of the
divine, and are linked by the thread of love.
Sadly, we have blemished this beautiful
relation of humanity by introducing the
concepts of caste, creed, gender and race.
These barriers were never God’s plan but
man’s will. Today, these boundaries have
disturbed mankind which is facing the harsh
consequences of its own actions.
But a bright change is always welcomed.
Instead of ruining this beautiful blessing of
the Almighty, let us recreate the relation we
share with one another. Let us remove these
differences and come together to enjoy life
together, in peace and harmony.</p>
<h3 id="happiness--i-choose">HAPPINESS – I CHOOSE</h3>
<p>It was a usual Monday afternoon, with the sun
glowing bright and the mercury soaring high.
As I was walking my way back home, I could
see troubled and angry faces all around. The
heat was unbearable for all. This entire scene
dosed off my mood until I saw two children,
taking respite under a tree. They were draped
in ragged pieces of cloth and surprisingly, they
were laughing uproariously and enjoying each
other’s company.
Well, friends, these underprivileged children
might not have gained high academic merit or
a fancy educational degree, yet they enjoyed
the best luxury of the world: happiness. Today,
we all seek happiness but fail to notice that it
lies within us. Nobody on this planet can make
us happy but we, ourselves, can. So, without
any delay, let us choose happiness today and
keep it with us forever. The decision is ours to
take!</p>
<h3 id="the-divine">THE DIVINE</h3>
<p>All my writings have been woven by a
common fibre: the divine. The supreme
motive of our lives is to return to the place
where we belong. Our journey is a mere
outing to explore the various aspects of this
world and remember our creator. The very
purpose of this outing is to make us realise the
importance of the divine.</p>
<p>So let us dwell in his remembrance and reunite
with him one day.</p>
<h3 id="the-virtue-of-forgiveness">THE VIRTUE OF FORGIVENESS</h3>
<p>We often share bitter experiences with one
another and when the situation gets worst, we
end our relation with each other. But, does the
Almighty perform the same when we commit
mistakes? He readily forgives us. Why can’t
we imbibe the same in our lives? It might
be difficult to forgive but it is rightly said by
Indira Gandhi, “Forgiveness is a virtue of the
brave”. It is the valiant who forget the past
mistakes and head towards the future.
Life is too short to live with differences,
to seek vengeance and to hold grudges. So
without wasting a single moment, let us
forgive all, forget all differences and enjoy the
little span of time that we have together.</p>
<h3 id="step-out-to-explore-life">STEP OUT TO EXPLORE LIFE</h3>
<p>Sitting in my armchair, I often wonder that
how long will the present sustain? Time shall
change in a trice, leaving behind a breeze of
acceptance. Today, we might be shelled and
protected by our families, however, tomorrow,
we ought to leave our little nests, to explore
the world and taste the various flavours of
life. We need to bear the grit and courage to
face the outside world. Well, this very thought
might sadden us but friends; this is the rule
of life. We must dare to complete our journey
alone. We ought to step out of our comfort
zone, tread difficult paths and ultimately
achieve our goal. Towards the end, it is this
courage that shall decide our fate.
So begin your journey fearlessly and head
towards your target.</p>
<h3 id="transience-of-life">TRANSIENCE OF LIFE</h3>
<p>Lately, a dear one of mine bid farewell to this
world. I am still enveloped by bewilderment
and sorrow. However, now I have realised
that every second is a grace of the divine. We
spend our entire life in the garb of pressure,
fear and anxiety. But who knows when one
ought to withdraw from the game of life. So
let us change ourselves. Let us enjoy the true
essence of life with each other’s love and
make our journey a beautiful ride, passing
by the stations of adventure, joy, humour and
thrill.</p>
<p>Well, my dear one has left a bag full of
blessings for me to live and most importantly,
a principle of life to be followed: enjoy before
it is too late. He might have gone very far but
his love shall help me sail through life.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-right-to-become-judgemental">IS IT RIGHT TO BECOME JUDGEMENTAL?</h3>
<p>The clouds of happiness as well as sorrow
veil the azure of life constantly. If we proudly
proclaim to understand this principle of life, then
why do we judge everyone? We meet millions
of people in a lifetime and consequently, form
zillions of thoughts about each individual
with just a glimpse of his life? Is it justified?
We might have had a sordid experience with
someone but do we know the story of his life.
How can we label him to be brutal or crude? He
might be braving a storm in his life. Instead of
forming filthy opinions, we should brighten his
life with some rays of love. Our primary motto
should be to teach, preach and talk of love, come
what may. Times change but our love for each
other shouldn’t abate ever.
So friends, let us weave a relation of love and set
aside all external opinions and perspectives, and
thus make our journey of life more beautiful than
before.</p>
<h3 id="the-war-against-fear">THE WAR AGAINST FEAR</h3>
<p>Fear has become an inseparable part of our
lives. It haunts us before every action, every
event and ends up ruining it too. But now, we
must find a permanent cure to this disease.
Well, friends, the cure lies within us. Fear is a
figment of our imagination and only our mind
can defeat it. We ought to trust ourselves and
our actions. We must strengthen our hearts to
face all tides. Our will and determination can
defeat it, only when we attempt to bring them
in action.
So, let us conquer our fear and ultimately,
draw nearer to our goal!</p>
<h3 id="sweet-is-thy-will">SWEET IS THY WILL</h3>
<p>Certain instances compel us to alter our
perspective towards life. Today, one such
incident deeply saddened me. The result was
far from my expectation. For a moment, I felt
that all my hard work was in vain. However, I
was oblivious of the fact that the divine is our
majesty, who has the master remote control
of our lives. His will shall prevail. Although,
dejection tried to bring me down, my faith
brought me back in action. We ought to give
our best and leave the rest for our creator to
decide. He shall truly account for all our hard
work and sincere efforts. In Him, we must
trust.
So, with a smile on my face and gratitude in
my heart, I am ready to overcome all storms
with my brilliance! No failure can deter me.
It’s time to shine!</p>
<h3 id="the-paper-origami-of-life">THE PAPER ORIGAMI OF LIFE</h3>
<p>As children, all of us have had the joyous
experience of doing paper origami: the art of
folding paper into unique shapes and figures.
We would often introduce new folds to the
paper to make our product, different from the
rest. Well, life is also handled the same way
except that we forget to make it different. We
tread the same, old occupational paths as our
forefathers. But, the right way to leading life is
by chasing our desires and dreams fearlessly.
The final outcome might not be the best but it
shall be unique in its own way. At the end, we
shall live a life worth remembering, and enjoy
the very essence of it.
So friends, gear up to introduce new creases
and folds in your paper origami with life,
because the finished product is for you to
preserve and cherish forever.</p>
<h3 id="the-courage-to-continue">THE COURAGE TO CONTINUE</h3>
<p>We, often reach a point in life where we lose
the hope to succeed and eventually, give up.
But these times test our true courage. If our
goal is constant, our efforts are sincere, our
determination is strong, then we ought to get
up and fight again. Repeated failures shouldn’t
deter us from pursuing our dream. The bravery
to try, yet again, is the true key to success.
So friends, when you face such situations,
listen to your inner voice, accept the challenge
to fight again and get back in action. Never
give up because you are closer to your
destination than you think!</p>
<h3 id="art--the-ultimate-expression">ART- THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION</h3>
<p>Art has a divine and seraphic connect with
our mind, body, and soul. Life often brings
us to a turn where our senses become numb
and weak enough to convey the message we
wish to share. The only form of expression left
thereafter, is art.</p>
<p>It is the only medium that can perfectly
showcase our emotions of happiness, surprise,
fear and anxiety. For me, art is my sole
companion that helps me display my feelings
with a handful of paints and brushes. It helps
me unload my stress and fear and invigorates
me with hope and courage to take up future
tasks.</p>
<p>I hope this friendship of ours lasts forever.</p>
<h2 id="health--a-prerequisite-to-success">HEALTH – A PREREQUISITE TO SUCCESS</h2>
<p>Physical fitness is a very integral component
for staying healthy. These days, we often
neglect our health and give it the lowest
rank in our priority chart. However, we are
oblivious of the fact that the dreams we are
aspiring for, can’t be achieved at the cost of
our health.
A healthy mind breeds healthy ideas and
innovative thoughts. On the contrary, lethargy
greatly increases our struggle to work and
think, taking us farther from our destination.
So, without any delay, let us chalk out our
fitness map today and bid farewell to all
those troubles that could hinder our vision for
tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="inspirations-all-around">INSPIRATIONS ALL AROUND</h3>
<p>We often talk about great kings and leaders
whose bravery serves as a source of
inspiration. But we forget to get inspired by
the small acts of people around us. We never
need success stories of millionaires but each
instance, each act, conveys a hidden message
for us to read and get motivated. The great
hard work of the labourers, the unparalleled
dedication of a student, the immense hope of
a devotee, the unconditional love of a mother
and the effervescence of an infant, are all
worth inspiration. If we imbibe each of these
in the right amount, imagine how colourful
and beautiful, life would become!</p>
<p>At the end, life is a canvas for us to paint. So
lift up your paintbrush, hold your palette firm
and paint your canvas with different hues of
inspiration.</p>
<h3 id="remembrance-of-our-origin">REMEMBRANCE OF OUR ORIGIN</h3>
<p>Today, we all have been engulfed by
materialism and have forgotten our supreme
origin. Worldly desires have engrossed us
in their midst, leaving no time for us to
remember the divine. We have descended
upon this planet to perform our role and then
depart for the eternal journey to our real
quarters, to the place where we belong.
So let us devote some time to our creator as
he is the one who shall remain by our side
forever&hellip;.</p>
<h3 id="the-glass-half-full-or--half-empty">THE GLASS: HALF FULL OR  HALF EMPTY</h3>
<p>This famous example of seeing the glass
‘half full’ or ‘half empty’, highlights the two
attitudes in life: optimistic and pessimistic.
Unfortunately, all of us see the glass half
empty because of our negative thoughts and
ideas. But this attitude is a major roadblock
for our future endeavours. A preconceived
negative outcome would never permit us to
give our best shot.
.
Well, friends, the right way to leading life
is by tracing the 0.001% positivity in direst
conditions too. This shall ignite confidence
and faith in self which can overturn any
situation in our favour.
So, it is time for us to view life under the lens
of optimism!</p>
<h3 id="the-baggage-of-memories">THE BAGGAGE OF MEMORIES</h3>
<p>As we progress in our journey called Life, we
visit various stations, make many companions
and ultimately pack all these memories
as our luggage and move to new stations.
The memories are a blend of bitter-sweet
experiences. Some instantly bring a smile
to our face while others invite sorrow and
desolation, the latter being a heavy load to
carry.
So why not unpack all the unpleasant
memories to create space for the new and
happy ones?
It is never too late to unload some luggage and
start our journey afresh&hellip;.
So good luck for new beginnings!</p>
<h3 id="my-dad-my-hero">MY DAD MY HERO</h3>
<p>The special occasion of father’s day compels
me to pen down my thoughts on my daddy.
As the title suggests, my dad means the
world to me. I could never sail through this
muddy world without his guidance. His big
and radiant smile serves as my daily appetite.
His teachings help me to tackle the harshest
situations too. My credence says that my dad
is the best gift given to me by the Almighty. I
wish I could hide my talisman from the entire
world.
I shall ensure that no sorrow ever overshadows
my hero’s life and I will love him always. Stay
happy daddy!</p>
<h3 id="a-mothers-embrace">A MOTHER’S EMBRACE</h3>
<p>A mother is the divine’s most beautiful
blessing. She introduces us to the world and
its rules, guides us through all the mysterious
roads with her experience and holds our hand
in all tough times. She is the beacon of light in
our lives. Her countless teachings help us sail
through life. We might not be able to return
her favour but we can express our gratitude by
turning into good human beings.
So let us become gentle beings and show the
greatest love to our mothers!</p>
<h3 id="a-siblings-companionship">A SIBLING’S COMPANIONSHIP</h3>
<p>Siblings are our greatest pals. They stand
beside us in all circumstances, be it the
storm or the sun. Their love is irreplaceable.
However, quite often, materialism, wealth and
selfish motives mar this beautiful relationship.
But, we ought to remember that nothing can
replace our beautiful companionship, our
endless chit-chat at night, our good night
kiss, our frequent walks in the lawn, and
most importantly, our love for each other.
These pristine relations are created by the
divine. So thank him for his gift and enjoy this
camaraderie, keeping the evils of egotism and
greed away.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-lap-of-nature">IN THE LAP OF NATURE</h3>
<p>A musty yellow tint veiled the sky and orange
clouds descended on the humble earthly
dwellings. The birds gently sat on the lush
green tree branches and embellished the
beautiful aura. Everything seemed to have
come to a still. Nature had embraced the entire
world, in its arms. This was nature’s way to
break the monotony of life.
Nature is indeed a marvellous creation of the
divine. It continues to radiate its love despite
man’s destructive practices.
So, friends, let us bring a permanent halt to
our evil means and preserve this pristine gift
of the Divine. It is never too late to change!</p>
<h3 id="our-karma-our-fate">OUR KARMA, OUR FATE</h3>
<p>Mystics often talk about the concept of karma
or actions. It is true that our actions, be it
miniscule or majuscule, are carefully recorded
in Lord’s log book and our fate is designed
accordingly. Hence, it can be concluded that
we ought to bear the brunt of all our activities.
So, if it all boils down to changing ourselves
and our deeds, why not embark on this
journey from today?
Let us sow the seeds of love, humanity,
kindness and reap the saplings of happiness
and peace in our garden of life. Start now!</p>
<h3 id="this-shall-also-pass">THIS SHALL ALSO PASS</h3>
<p>The famous saying “this shall also pass”
provides a constant fuel to our vehicle of life.
Life is a colourful composition of victory and
failure, happiness and sadness, brightness and
darkness. Absence of any of these ingredients
makes the dish of life bitter to taste. Hence,
we need to adopt an attitude that enables us
to face all challenges and adversities with a
big smile. Failure and darkness are the best
teachers. Today, if we learn to face these two
dark critics, then brightness and success shall
indeed form our future.
So greet all situations of life happily and
victory is all yours&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="losing-all-the-battles-yet-winning-the-war">LOSING ALL THE BATTLES YET WINNING THE WAR</h3>
<p>Today, I lost a battle of life. Desolation and
dejection became my counterparts after the
loss.
Then, my heart reminded me that it was yet
another battle that gave me the experience to
brave greater battles. The war is still not over.
When one aims to reach the zenith of success,
he might face small failures. However, the grit
to continue shall decide the ultimate outcome.
Such failures make our determination stronger
and our vision brighter. So, let us gear up to
fight the battles that follow because the war
continues&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="drenched-in-rain">DRENCHED IN RAIN</h3>
<p>The grey hue veiling the sky makes me
wonder how our harsh circumstances resemble
the darkness enveloping the luminosity of sun.
Our bright and joyous journey of life is marred
with difficulties and mishaps. All we need is
an umbrella of faith and rain-boots of courage
to step out on the battlefield and enjoy the
fight because post the rain, the sun shall shine
yet again. Each difficulty is a gentle reminder
of the immense bravery and power that we
possess. We must discover it within us.</p>
<h3 id="the-recipe-of-life">THE RECIPE OF LIFE</h3>
<p>Today, while attempting to bake a dish for
myself, I faced great trouble in deciding the
appropriate quantity of each ingredient. Life
is no different. It is a dish for us to prepare
with all constituents in the right proportion.
However, we often choose work and distress
over family and enjoyment, cooking a bitter
meal at the end. Balance is the rule of leading
a good life. Work shall never cease to exist,
desires shall never come to an end but happy
moments seldom arrive. So, while walking
towards our destination, let us stop for a while,
appreciate the beauty around us, and enjoy
each other’s companionship. This shall indeed
be the best recipe ever!</p>
